8.4 Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Imposter syndrome is a common psychological phenomenon in which individuals doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a "fraud," despite evidence of their competence. This can be particularly prevalent in the tech industry due to the rapid pace of change and high expectations. In this subsection, we will provide tips and strategies for recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome in your tech career.

a) Acknowledging Your Accomplishments

- Share your accomplishments with trusted friends, mentors, or colleagues, who can provide validation and encouragement.

b) Embracing a Growth Mindset
